# Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a simple static web page that converts a markdown file (`input.md`) to HTML and renders it inside the `#markdown-output` div. It uses `marked` for markdown parsing and `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting of code blocks.

## How to Use

1. Place your markdown content in the `input.md` file.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. The markdown content will be rendered as HTML with syntax highlighting for code blocks.
